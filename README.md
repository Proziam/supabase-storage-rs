This is a Rust implementation of the [supabase storage client](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-createbucket). The goal is to have feature parity and an easy-to-use API.

Currently this software is functional, but not yet battle-tested.

## Contributions

Contributors are always welcome. I only ask that you add or update tests to cover your changes. Until this crate reaches 1.0.0 we're in the "move fast and break things" phase. Don't concern yourself with elegance.
